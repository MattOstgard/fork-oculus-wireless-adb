In order to avoid manually typing the randomly generated port each time, this is an mDNS discovery 
script for the service types used on the Meta Quest headsets for ADB: 
`_adb_secure_connect._tcp.local` (Android 10) and `_adb-tls-connect._tcp.local` (Android 12).

This is done in order to automatically discover the IP and port of the spawned ADB TLS server and
establish the connection.

```
$ pip3 install -r requirements.txt
[...]

$ python3 discover-and-connect.py
